# About the project

https://moveit-nlw4-italo.vercel.app/

Project completed in Rocketseat's NLW week using NextJs.
moveIt is an application based on the Pomodoro technique to give time intervals for those who spend a lot of time in front of the computer.
In each interval the user needs to do a physical activity to relax the muscles and mind.
When completing the activity, the user must click on the completed option to earn points and consequently advance to the next level.
